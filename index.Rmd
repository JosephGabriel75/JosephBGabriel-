## **About**

Welcome to the official website of Joseph Gabriel. I am currently a Sophmore pre-med at Rowan University. Over the past few months I have become increasingly passionate about data analytics. 

I made this website to document everything I learn, and share a bit about myself with the world. My website has no ads, affiliates spondored posts or paywalls. Just want to make data more accesible. Hope you enjoy the content. 




## Education 

  * B.S in Biology at Rowan with a minor in Chemistry
  * Westfield High School 2014-2018

##### The following is a very basis rendering of graph using the prgogram language R. In the future I plan to make tutorials on how to use this awesome language! 

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}

mpg %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=reorder(class, hwy), y=hwy, fill=class)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    xlab("class") +
    theme(legend.position="none") 


```


```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
hotels <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv')
```

```{r}


ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Sepal Width", y =  "Sepal Length") + 
  ggtitle("Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica Measurments") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)) + 
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_size_area() 



```
